Software Configuration
=========================================================

Getting the Software
********************

There are 2 ways of running the XP3000 GUI:

- Running the *window_controller.exe* [Windows only]
- Running *from source* [Python required]

Either way the user must first download the necessary files for the software,
located at http://www.github.com/bergercookie/Cavro-Pump-XP3000-GUI. This can be 
done either by downloading the project locally from the github page or by cloning the project


The user can *download the software* by visiting the github page:
http://www.github.com/bergercookie/Cavro-Pump-XP3000-GUI and then pressing 
the TODO<Download the Desktop> Button.

See picture <TODO> for an example case

In order to **clone** the project the user must first make sure that git is installed 
on the platform. If it isn't then installing it requires issuing::

    sudo apt-get install git "for Linux users - command-line
    sudo port install git "MacOS users - command-line
    TODO installing for windows

Then in order to clone the project the user can run the git clone command::
    
    git clone http://wwww.github.com/bergercookie/Cavro-Pump-XP3000-GUI.git 

After the previous steps the user should locally have a copy of the project.

Running the .exe 
************************

*Running the executable* version of the project is as simple as running the window_controller.exe
located in the <location_to_project>/build folder.

Running from source
************************

In case the user wants to run the software *from source*, a basic python distribution 
must be installed on the platform, (already preconfigured on most \*NIX systems). 
The user must also have the following packages installed:

- pyserial
- PySide

After this configuration, the user can run the software from the command-line [\*NIX]
command-prompt [Windows]::

    python window_controller.py

Note that the user must first go to the folder, the window_controller.py is located.

Using the software
************************


The first thing the user should do, if he doesn't know the serial connector 
to the pump, is figure out the correct port:

- On **Windows** machines this can be done by getting the *'Ports (COM & LPT)'* tab::

    Start Menu > right-click "My Computer" > select "Manage" >  Click on the "Device Manager"

    (On the "Device Manager") Click "Ports (COM & LPT)" tab > select the port your connector is on
  
- On **\*NIX** machines this can be done the following way::
  
    cd /dev

    ls -lart| grep tty

This will give  you a list of the currently available ports. Ejecting and reinserting the connector 
to the computer and in the meantime running the second command again will help you recognise 
the port the pump is running on.


    
<TODO insert images!!>

.. Warning::

    Make sure that you have selected the correct port, otherwise the pump will not respond and will
    not raise any error Message

After that you are ready to run the software (whichever way you want). You should be directed to the New_Device window where the
port connected to the pump must be selected <TODO image ref>

<TODO> insert the image

If you have selected the correct port, the connection to the pump is established and 
the software will automatically initialize the pump, by moving the plunger to the upper position.

You are now in the Main Window. From here you can:

- Command a volume delivery,
- Change the speed of the plunger,
- Issue a quick command to the pump (halt, push_all, etc) 

<TODO> image 

You can also select the editor's tab in order to issue a series of commands to the pump 
and either run it or save it for later use.

From the main window you can navigate to a series of other dialogs: 

- **History Window**

  From here the user can see all the commands sent to the pump which can be devided to 2 types:

  * Commands issued by the user

  * Commands issued by the software to decide pump status

- **Syringe Size**

  The user can decide the syringe size.

- **Pump_Settings Window**

  Gives the user an overview of the pump currently configured settings

<TODO insert the rest of the windows>
